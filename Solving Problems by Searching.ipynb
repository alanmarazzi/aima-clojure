    "# Problem Solving Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "A **problem-solving agent** uses **atomic** representations - states of the world are considered as wholes, without internal structure - to **search** for a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main families of such algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uninformed**: given the problem definition, will find a solution\n",
    "- **Informed**: need more guidance to solve a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals and Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "With **goals** we help organize the behaviour by limiting the objectives the agent is trying to achieve. **Goal formulation** is the first step in problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem formulation** is the process of deciding what actions and states to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding we have to list our assumptions about the **environment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Observable* -> the agent always knows the current state\n",
    "- *Discrete* -> in any given state there is only a finite number of actions\n",
    "- *Known* -> the agent knows which states are reached by each action\n",
    "- *Deterministic* -> each action has exactly one outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "### Under these assumptions the solution to any problem is a fixed sequence of actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $Problem->Sequence \\: of \\: actions->Solution$\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of looking for a sequence of actions that reaches the goal is called **search**. A search algorithm takes a problem as input and returns a solution in the form of an action sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define Problems and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem can be defined formally by 5 components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial state** -> The state the agent starts in\n",
    "- **Actions** -> A description of what an agent can do\n",
    "- **Transition model** -> Description of what each action does\n",
    "- **Goal test** -> Determines whether a given state is a goal state\n",
    "- **Path cost** -> Function that assigns a numeric cost to each path\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "# Searching for Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "The possible action sequences starting at the initial state form a **search tree** with the initial state at the root. The branches are actions and the nodes correspond to states in the state space of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start at the root node by expanding the current state by applying each legal action to the current state. In this way we generate a new set of states. This is the essence of search: following up one option and putting the others aside for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see below, the **Problem** can be represented in an abstract way and then used to build more specific problems without having to reimplement everything. As stated before to have a well defined problem we have the `initial` state, the `actions` listing and describing what the agent can do, the `goal_test` and the `path_cost`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nodes** in a tree are a data structure from which the tree itself is constructed. Each node must have a parent, a state and various fields recording actions, costs, etc."

    "# Uninformed Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uninformed search** strategies work without any additional information about states beyond that provided in the problem definition: all they can do is to generate successors and distinguish between a goal state and a non-goal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we find a summary description of the main uninformed search strategies and their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breadth-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a simple strategy: the *root* node is expanded first, then all the successors of the root are expanded next, then their successors and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breadth-first** is poised to find a solution eventually if given enough time and memory. For this algorithm the main issue is memory since it increases pretty fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uniform-cost search\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of expanding the shallowest node, **uniform-cost search** expands the node with the lowest path cost $g(n)$. This algorithm is optimal because it expands nodes in order of their optimal path cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Depth-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "Always expand the deepest node in the current *frontier* up to the node that has no successors. After expanding the nodes, they are dropped from the frontier, in this way search continues backing up to unexpanded nodes. By dropping nodes the memory requirements are much less than **breadth-first**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Depth-limited search\n",
    "\n",
    "In infinite spaces **depth-first** will run forever or until it runs out of memory. To avoid this we can feed the algorithm with $l$, a predetermined depth at which the tree treats the nodes as having no successors. This is **depth-limited search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Iterative deepening depth-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "We usually use **iterative deepening** in combination with **depth-first**: we gradually increase the limit $l$ until a solution is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bidirectional search\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to run 2 simultaneous searches: one from the root and one from the goal hoping that the searches meet in the middle. We do it by replacing the goal test with a check to see whether the frontiers of the two intersect."

    "# Informed (Heuristic) Search Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**Informed search** using problem specific knowledge can find solutions more efficiently than **uninformed strategies**. The general approach is to use [**best-first search**](#uniform-cost): it is always based on tree or graph search, but the nodes are selected for expansion by using an **evaluation function** $f(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most **best-first** algos include as a component of $f(n)$ a **heuristic function** denoted $h(n)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "h(n) = estimated\\: cost\\: of\\: cheapest\\: path\\: from\\: state\\: in\\: \\textbf{n}\\: to\\: a\\: goal\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Greedy Best-first search\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy best-first** tries to expand the node that is closest to the goal considering only $f(n)=h(n)$. This makes it try to optimize every step by getting as closer as possible to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A\\* search\n",
    "\n",
    "**A\\*** is the most known form of best-first search: it evaluates nodes by combining $g(n)$ - the cost to reach the node - and $h(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that $f(n)$ represents the *estimated cost of the cheapest solution through n*. In this way **A\\*** is both *complete* and *optimal* (while greedy best-first is neither). But to be complete and optimal we require 2 conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Admissible heuristic** -> the heuristic must never overestimate the cost to reach the goal\n",
    "- **Consistency** -> for every *n* and every successor *n'* generated by any action *a*, the estimated cost of reaching the goal from n is no greater than the step cost of getting to *n'* plus the estimated cost of reaching the goal from *n'* (required only by graph search) - basically we are ensuring that the triangle inequality holds true\n",
    "\n",
    "**A\\*** ensures optimality because everytime it selects a node for expansion does it through the optimal path to that node. This is because we have nondecreasing f-costs along any path, so to show how it works we can draw contours in the state space \n",
    "\n",
    "![contours](http://i.imgur.com/mBwiGMD.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside contours we are sure that every node will have the same or less $f(n)$ value. The nodes outside contours are not considered for expansion, so in the figure above we say that the subtree below *T* is **pruned**. Moreover, **A\\*** is **optimally efficient**, meaning that no other algorithm of this type can expand fewer nodes than **A\\***."
